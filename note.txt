symbols (alphabet) -> a symbol in the set [R,W,S,X]
states -> continuous domain
	Could use ANN to classify as one of X states?
transitions -> probabilities of transitioning between states
outputs -> probability of outputting symbol X when in state Y
priors -> initial state distribution (probability of starting in state S)
